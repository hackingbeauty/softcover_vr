# Adding or Buying Artwork
\label{cha:a_chapter}

This is the first paragraph of the Softcover Markdown template produced with the \softcover\ command-line interface. It shows how to write a document in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, augmented with the [kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/) converter and some custom extensions, including support for embedded \PolyTeX, a subset of the powerful \LaTeX\ typesetting system.  For more information, see [*The Softcover Book*](http://manual.softcover.io/book). To learn how to easily publish (and optionally sell) documents produced with Softcover, visit [Softcover.io](http://softcover.io/).
